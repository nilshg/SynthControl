# Abadie, Diamond and Hainmüller (2010) Synthetic Control Model

The `ADH2011` model is in some sense the canonical Synthetic Control Model. It is set out in
[Abadie, Diamond and Hainmüller (2010,
JASSA)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08746)[^1], which estimates the
effects of proposition 99, a change to tobacco advertising rules in California, on smoking rates in
the state. 

The method was initially introduced in [Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455188)[^2].
