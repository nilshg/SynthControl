# Matrix Completion with Nuclear Norm Minimization

The Matrix Completion with Nuclear Norm Minimization estimator was proposed by [Athey et al. (2021,
JASSA)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1891924)[^1].

## Implementation in `SynthControl`

!!! Note

    The implementation is adapted from that in the R package [`fect`](https://github.com/xuyiqing/fect/) and should currently be seen as experimental.
